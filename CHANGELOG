# 3.1.0
- Feature: Listening IP and external IP can now be separated with `config ipv4 bind <bind_ipv4_addr>` and `config ipv4 external <external_ipv4_addr>` to help with properly setting up networking.
- Fixed: Session cookies (cookies with no expiry date set) are now correctly captured every time. There is no need to specify `:always` key modifier for `auth_tokens` to capture them.
- Fixed: Captured custom tokens are now displayed properly and values are not truncated.

# 3.0.0
- Feature: TLS certificates from LetsEncrypt will now get automatically renewed.
- Feature: Automated retrieval and renewal of LetsEncrypt TLS certificates is now managed by `certmagic` library.
- Feature: Authentication tokens can now be captured not only from cookies, but also from response body and HTTP headers.
- Feature: Phishing pages can now be embedded inside of iframes.
- Feature: Changed redirection after successful session capture from `Location` header redirection to injected Javascript redirection.
- Feature: Changed config file from `config.yaml` to `config.json`, permanently changing the configuration format to JSON.
- Feature: Changed open-source license from GPL to BSD-3.
- Feature: Added `always` modifier for capturing authentication cookies, forcing to capture a cookie even if it has no expiration time.
- Feature: Added `phishlet <phishlet>` command to show details of a specific phishlet.
- Feature: Added phishlet templates, allowing to create child phishlets with custom parameters like pre-configured subdomain or domain. Parameters can be defined anywhere in the phishlet file as `{param_name}` and every occurence will be replaced with pre-configured parameter values of the created child phishlet.
- Feature: Added `phishlet create` command to create child phishlets from template phishlets.
- Feature: Renamed lure `templates` to lure `redirectors` due to name conflict with phishlet templates.
- Feature: Added `{orig_hostname}` and `{orig_domain}` support for `sub_filters` phishlet setting.
- Feature: Added `{basedomain}` and `{basedomain_regexp}` support for `sub_filters` phishlet setting.
- Fixed: One target can now have multiple phishing sessions active for several different phishlets.
- Fixed: Cookie capture from HTTP packet response will not stop mid-term, ignoring missing `opt` cookies, when all authentication cookies are already captured.
- Fixed: `trigger_paths` regexp will now match a full string instead of triggering true when just part of it is detected in URL path.
- Fixed: Phishlet table rows are now sorted alphabetically.
- Fixed: Improved phishing session management to always create a new session when lure URL is hit if session cookie is not present, even when IP whitelist is set.
- Fixed: WebSocket connections are now properly proxied.

# 2.4.0
- Feature: Create and set up pre-phish HTML templates for your campaigns. Create your HTML file and place `{lure_url_html}` or `{lure_url_js}` in code to manage redirection to the phishing page with any form of user interaction. Command: `lures edit <id> template <template>`
- Feature: Create customized hostnames for every phishing lure. Command: `lures edit <id> hostname <hostname>`.
- Feature: Support for routing connection via SOCKS5 and HTTP(S) proxies. Command: `proxy`.
- Feature: IP blacklist with automated IP address blacklisting and blocking on all or unauthorized requests. Command: `blacklist`
- Feature: Custom parameters can now be embedded encrypted in the phishing url. Command: `lures get-url <id> param1=value1 param2="value2 with spaces"`.
- Feature: Requests to phishing urls can now be rejected if User-Agent of the visitor doesn't match the whitelist regular expression filter for given lure. Command: `lures edit <id> ua_filter <regexp>`
- List of custom parameters can now be imported directly from file (text, csv, json). Command: `lures get-url <id> import <params_file>`.
- Generated phishing urls can now be exported to file (text, csv, json). Command: `lures get-url <id> import <params_file> export <export_file> <text|csv|json>`.
- Fixed: Requesting LetsEncrypt certificates multiple times without restarting. Subsequent requests would result in "No embedded JWK in JWS header" error.
- Removed setting custom parameters in lures options. Parameters will now only be sent encoded with the phishing url.
- Added `with_params` option to `sub_filter` allowing to enable the sub_filter only when specific parameter was set with the phishing url.
- Made command help screen easier to read.
- Improved autofill for `lures edit` commands and switched positions of `<id>` and the variable name.
- Increased the duration of whitelisting authorized connections for whole IP address from 15 seconds to 10 minutes.

# 2.3.3
- Fixed: Multiple concurrent map writes when whitelisting IPs during heavy loads.

# 2.3.2
- ACMEv2 support added to comply with LetsEncrypt requirements.
- Fixed session cookie output to support EditThisCookie on the latest Chrome version.
- Increased timeouts for proxying HTTP packets to 45 seconds.
- Added support for Go modules.

# 2.3.1
- Redirection is now triggered only for responses with `text/html` content-type header.

# 2.3.0
- Proxy can now create most of required `sub_filters` on its own, making it much easier to create new phishlets.
- Added lures, with which you can prepare custom phishing URLs with each having its own set of unique options (`help lures` for more info).
- Added OpenGraph settings for lures, allowing to create enticing content for link previews.
- Added ability to inject custom Javascript into proxied pages.
- Injected Javascript can be customized with values of custom parameters, specified in lure options.
- Deprecated `landing_path` and replaced it with `login` section, which contains the domain and path for website's login page.

# 2.2.1
- Fixed: `type` with value `json` was not correctly activated when set under `credentials`.

# 2.2.0
- Now when any of `auth_urls` is triggered, the redirection will take place AFTER response cookies for that request are captured.
- Regular expression groups working with `sub_filters`.
- Phishlets are now listed in a table.
- Restructured phishlet YAML config file to be easier to understand (phishlets from previous versions need to be updated to new format).
- Phishlet fields are now selectively lowercased and validated upon loading to prevent surprises.
- All search fields in the phishlet are now regular expressions by default (remember about proper escaping!).
- Added option to capture custom POST arguments additionally to credentials. Check `custom` field under `credentials`.
- Added feature to inject custom POST arguments to requests. Useful when forcing users to tick that "Remember me" checkbox.
- Removed 'name' variable from phishlets. Phishlet name is now determined solely based on the filename.
